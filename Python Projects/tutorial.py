#
# Purpose: The Tech Academy - Python Course. Creating our first program together.
#          Demonstrating how to pass variables from function to function
#          while producing a functional game.
#
#          Remember. function_name(variable) _means that we pass in the variable,
#          return variable _means that we are returning the variable to
#          back to the calling function.
